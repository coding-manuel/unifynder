## About The Project

We hate going through the same tedious work again and again, hence, we cleared this issue by implementing our own Locker, which serves as a secure place to store ones mark-sheets and other important documents which are essential for admission. So regardless of where you are, you can access them from our app which stores it in a secure folder over the cloud.
